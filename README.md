Automation of GO-MWU files

The code belonging to the automation of GO enrichment analysis can be used to process multiple GO-enrichment within a loop, allowing the process to be automated. The code can be seen and is described in the GO_automation_md.html file. However, although also stated in the GO_automation_md.html, I would like to once again mention the code used actually run the GO enrichment comparisons analysis belongs to the authors of the manuscript: Wright, R. M., Aglyamova, G. V., Meyer, E. and Matz, M. V. Gene expression associated with white syndromes in a reef-building coral, Acropora hyacinthus. BMC Genomics 2015, 16: 371.
