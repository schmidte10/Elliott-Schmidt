# GO_MWU automation

Automation of GO-MWU files

The code belonging to the automation of GO enrichment analysis can be used to process multiple GO-enrichment within a loop, allowing the process to be automated. The R script for the code can be downloaded from the GO-automation.R file and is described in the GO_automation_md.html file. However, it is important to mention that the code used to run the GO enrichment comparisons analysis belongs to the authors of the manuscript: Wright, R. M., Aglyamova, G. V., Meyer, E. and Matz, M. V. Gene expression associated with white syndromes in a reef-building coral, Acropora hyacinthus. BMC Genomics 2015, 16: 371. The code within this repisotory simply describes how the a loop can be set up to run numerous comaprisons within a loop - allowing the process to be automated. Please read the GO_automation.md.html file for a complete line-by-line description of the code written in the GO-automation.R script.
